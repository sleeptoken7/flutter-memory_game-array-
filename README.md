Fruit Memory Game
A web-based card-matching game built with Flutter and Dart. The game uses array-based logic to manage a 4Ã—3 grid of cards, randomly shuffling fruit pairs at startup. Players flip two cards per turn, with the game tracking matches and attempts.

Key Features:

Array-driven card management and matching logic
Randomized card positions on each game start
Attempt counter and match progress tracking
Simple UI with Flutter's reactive components
Cross-platform web compatibility
Built with VS Code using Flutter SDK, this project demonstrates Dart programming fundamentals and memory game mechanics.
